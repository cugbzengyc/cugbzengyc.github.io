I am an associate professor of igneous petrology and geochemistry at the [School of Earth Sciences and Resources] (http://www.sesr.cugb.edu.cn/), [China University of Geosciences, Beijing] (http://www.cugb.edu.cn/). My research group integrates field geology with a variety of geochemical techniques to investigate the petrogenesis (source, magma storage, evolution and eruption) of igneous rocks on the Tibetan Plateau. Our primary goal is to enhance our understanding of how this vastest and highest landmass was formed. Specifically, I focus on the interaction between lithospheric processes (ranging from oceanic subduction to continental collision), magmatism, and surface responses. If you are interested in being pat of us, please feel free to contact me.
