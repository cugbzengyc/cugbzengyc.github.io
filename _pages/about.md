I am an associate professor of igneous petrology and geochemistry at China University of Geosciences, Beijing. My research group integrates field geology with a variety of geochemical techniques to investigate the petrogenesis (source, magma storage, evolution and eruption) of igneous rocks on the Tibetan Plateau. Our primary goal is to enhance our understanding of how this vastest and highest landmass was formed. Specifically, I focus on the interaction between lithospheric processes (ranging from oceanic subduction to continental collision), magmatism, and surface responses.
